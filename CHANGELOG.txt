This Changelog documents breaking changes, typically plugin API or database changes. 

2016-04-28: CHANGE: Changed the db_reporter API to include a context parameter. 
                    That is db_report(org, sync_db) became db_report(context, org, sync_db).
            REASON: This allows db reports access to the github_url context parameter, allowing them to work with private GitHub instances. 
            ACTION: Users should update any custom db-reporters to include the context parameter.
